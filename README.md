# Anomaly detection using Kmean

Four temperature censors were fitted in the four corners of a room. Each of them take a temperature reading every 30 minutes. There is a door in the front of the room, that we suspect was opened at some point during the measurement. My task is to determine whether the door was open or not. 

The data includes a time-stamp and readings from four sensors: front-left reading, front-right reading, back-left reading, and back-right reading.
