# Anomaly detection using Kmean

## Project Overview
Four temperature sensors were fitted in the four corners of a room. Each of them takes a temperature reading every 30 minutes. There is a door in the front of the room, that we suspect was opened at some point during the measurement. My task is to determine whether the door was open or not. 

## Dataset
The data includes a time-stamp and readings from four sensors: front-left reading, front-right reading, back-left reading, and back-right reading.

## Project components
1. EDA
2. Kmean and PCA
3. Conclusion
